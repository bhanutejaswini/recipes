    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Crispy Seasoned French Fries. They even stay crispy when you reheat them
      in the microwave.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Garlic powder</li>
      <li>Onion powder</li>
      <li>Raisins</li>
      <li>Paprika</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of
        cold water to prevent them from turning brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic powder, onion powder,
        paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to
        make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
      <li>
        Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from
        clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about
        7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
